\chapter{Requirement Analysis}\label{chap:requirement}
The approach starts with the problem definition and continues with what you have done. Try to give an intuition first and describe everything with words and then be more formal like `Let $g$ be ...'.

Strive to make the following items crystal clear to your readers.
\begin{itemize}
\item What is the problem you are treating?
\item What are the research questions you want to answer in this work?
\item What are your own contributions and what is work of others? If
  you are working in a team, it is important to demarcate against the
  contributions of others in your team.
\end{itemize}

Describe each major technical problem and how it was solved.
